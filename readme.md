# Bootstrap Challenge 

It's time to add bootstrap to your LinkedIn profile you created earlier!

## Release 0 - Planning: 
Come up with a plan for how you are going to implement your solution. How will you split the page up into columns and rows? What Bootstrap classes already exist that will help you create sections on the page? Will you need to add your own styles? What behavior does the page have? Can you recreate that with Bootstrap or will you need to write some custom Javascript? 

Try to make Bootstrap work for you as much as possible. Dig into the docs, read a few articles, do some research before you dive into the code. 

## Release 1 - HTML:
Start by editing your HTML file. Think about what tags you'll need. Remember, CSS is how we style and handle layout, HTML is about structure and meaning. Can you use Bootstrap elements to create a better looking site?

## Release 2 - Layout: 
Start positioning your elements using Bootstrap's columns and rows. Don't worry about colors and fonts just yet. You will want to think about font-size though as adjusting this can break your layout pretty quickly. 

## Release 3 - Style: 
Add colors, images, fonts or anything else you want to make your page look as close to the original as possible.
